# Questions

1. **Which flag or option will allow you to add a URL to the command?**  
   The answer is pretty simple here - the flag **`-u`**

2. **Which flag would you use to add data to a POST request?**  
   We'd use the **`--data`** flag to add data to the POST request.

3. **There are two parameters: username and password. How would you tell sqlmap to use the username parameter for the attack?**  
   **`-p username`**

4. **Which flag would you use to show the advanced help menu?**  
   **`-hh`** (Help Help)

5. **Which flag allows you to retrieve everything?**  
   **`-a`** (stands for "ALL")

6. **Which flag allows you to select the database name?**  
   **`-D`**

7. **Which flag would you use to retrieve database tables?**  
   **`--tables`**

8. **Which flag allows you to retrieve a tableâ€™s columns?**  
   **`--columns`**

9. **Which flag allows you to dump all the database table entries?**  
   **`--dump-all`**

10. **Which flag will give you an interactive SQL Shell prompt?**  
    **`--sql-shell`**

11. **You know the current db type is 'MYSQL'. Which flag allows you to enumerate only MySQL databases?**  
    **`--dbms=mysql`**

# 2. Task

Started by running the default Nmap scan  
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*aKqJcjz-S4A2rfKKFLgi_g.png"/>

I found port 80 to be open.  
I then ran the service scan and default script scan  
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*44gR1pPCmHj0Z9TLOY4h1A.png"/>

I accessed the website and found out this  
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*hQD9yyJC1RBVoOYZxtIt_g.png"/>

Next, I ran the Gobuster tool to find any available directories. I found *`/blood`*.  
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*W_45-5tCkvPP_8DtvRaSug.png"/>

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*ajBjp9VfEGb-iKZn3d5mTQ.png"/>

It had a login page and registration. I clicked on the login and then used Burp Suite to intercept the login page and save it to a TXT file  
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*r0uh1MABWoLYj-lBzCXmTQ.png"/>

We now use SQLMap to enumerate the databases for usernames, passwords, and all data that can be found in it.

To enumerate for the current database  
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*EW05Ww5JElR-3ZSqIfWfvw.png"/>

We find the DB to be *`blood`*.

Now that we know the name of the database, we look for tables available in the DB  
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*4NDEQwAjMIyDVvbbvX_LrQ.png">

Now that we are interested in the flag table, we run the dump command to find its details

## Conclusion

Mitigating against exploiting SQL injection flaws and protecting database servers is crucial for maintaining data security and preventing unauthorized access. You need to consider:

- **Implementing Input Validation and Parameterized Queries**: Apply stringent input validation techniques to sanitize user inputs and eliminate potentially malicious SQL statements. Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure that user inputs are treated as data rather than executable code.
- **Applying Principle of Least Privilege**: Restrict database user privileges to the minimum required for their respective tasks. Avoid using privileged accounts for routine operations and assign specific access rights based on user roles. This limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict even if they manage to exploit an SQL injection flaw.
- **Regularly Updating and Patching Database Software**: Keep the database management system (DBMS) software up to date with the latest security patches. Stay informed about vulnerabilities and exploits related to the specific DBMS and promptly apply relevant patches to protect against known attack vectors.
- **Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**: Implement a WAF that is capable of detecting and blocking SQL injection attempts. WAFs can analyze incoming requests, identify suspicious SQL statements, and prevent them from reaching the database server. This adds an additional layer of defense against SQL injection attacks.
- **Conducting Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**: Perform comprehensive security audits and penetration tests on your application and database infrastructure. Engage with experienced security professionals to identify and address any existing vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Regular testing helps in proactively identifying SQL injection flaws and taking appropriate mitigation measures.

By following these key points, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and ensure the integrity and security of their database servers. It is essential to adopt a proactive approach to security, keeping up with the latest best practices and staying vigilant against emerging threats.

### Summary Questions

1. **What is the name of the interesting directory?**  
   *`blood`*

2. **Who is the current db user?**  
   *`root`*

3. **What is the final flag?**  
   *`thm{sqlm@p_is_L0ve}`*
